# Jupyter Notebook Tutorial 

Jupyter Notebook is a programming environment specific to the Python programming language. I find the Jupyter Notebook environment incredibly convenient to rapidly test and document code, so I wanted to create a tutorial for people new to Jupyter Notebook. 

### Getting Started

All of the working files are Jupyter Notebook files denoted by the .ipynb extension, so you will need Jupyter Notebook installed. Thankfully installing Jupyter Notebook is incredibly quickly and convenient. For instructions on installing Jupyter Notebook refer to the [installation documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
